[*I, Robot*](https://github.com/michaelshiloh/resourcesForClasses/blob/master/doc/I_Robot.pdf) 
by Isaac Asimov: "Little Lost Robot" page 112

1. **Superior Being:** Once again, robots are considered as a superior being. "Physically, and, to an extent, mentally, a robot-any robot-is superior to human being"(119). Instead of trying to keep robots as slaves through the First Law or fearing of robots taking control, we could learn so much from them as well as gain a fresh new perspective. Robots could help us surpass another limit in our advancement. Would co-existence be possible or one must live in fear of one another? What could we do to get rid of this fear?
2. **Emotions:** I couldn't help but feel that Nestor 10 expresses some sort of feelings when he is talking to Dr. Calvin. "He would think me a failure-He told me- But it's not so-I am powerful and intelligent-" he says. This sounds like what a person would say when they were angry or very upset after they got misjudged by someone. In general, should robots receive the same treatments as people? 
3. **The First Law:** The modification of the First Law is the reason why all these disasters happen. Are any circumstances where the First Law could be modified? 
4. **Debugging:** Shouldn't there a better way to differentiate the Nestor robots besides using psychological tests? For instance, shouldn't engineers and programmers have a way to record robots' memory in a log? Finding Nestor 10 would be so easy if they were able to check their logs.
5. **Resetting Robots:** Another solution that I am thinking of while reading this story is to reset these robots completely like resetting your phones or macbooks. I find this method less extreme than Dr. Calvin's suggestion of destroying these robots. Would wiping and resetting robots be considered unethical? What are the possible implications of this method?
