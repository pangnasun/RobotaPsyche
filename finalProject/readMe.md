# Final Project: Simulating a Simple Ecosystem

### Project Concept
My project is about creating an evironment where, initially, animals  of different kinds are randomly put together to interact. Like a real world ecosystem, animals have these relations such as preys, predators, or allies (same species). However, these relations will be randomly assinged to them, so they need to figure this out through interactions. For instance, when animal A notices that another animal of its kind (same features like color, size, speed) gets eaten by animal B, animal A will learn to avoid animal B. Animal A learns that animal B is a predator. On the other hand, animal B will notice that any animals that have same features as the animal it had eaten are its preys.
