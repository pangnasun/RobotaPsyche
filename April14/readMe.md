### My Final Project Idea

I plan to create an ecosystem where initially different species of animals are together. Shortly afterward, some animals will eat other animals while some will to protect others. These animals need to diffrentiate which animals are predators, which are preys, and which are their allies in order to survive in this dangerious environment. Thus, association will be implmentd in these animals to help them identify others as dangerous, food, or friends. In addition, these animals will also be able to decide when it is the best time to go hunt for food, when it is safe to eat, when they need to keep moving as well as where to stay to be safe from their predators. When the ecosystem reaches an equilibrium when preys and their allies are grouped and moving together while predators are grouped and move together.
