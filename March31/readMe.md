- [Steffen Steinert's "The Five Robots—A Taxonomy for Roboethics"](https://github.com/michaelshiloh/resourcesForClasses/blob/master/doc/theFiveRobotsATaxonomyForRoboethics.pdf).
1. **Status as a person:** "In the past, blacks, gypsies, children, women, foreigners, corporations, prisoners, and Jews have been regarded at some points in history as being legal non-persons" (Steiner 252). Are we repeating the "past" by considering/labeling/defining robots as non-persons or robots are a completely different case? Steinert mentions how "societies 'make' persons, because persons are 'produced' by a process of personification, which is conferring the status of a person to something" (252). Since "being a person" is defined as a status made by the society to bestow on a person, couldn't we do the same thing to robots? Of course, the following-up question would be: is a certain robot deemed worthy enough to receive that honor and how do we determine a robot's worthiness? Should robots undergo to be certified as "persons"?
2. **Robots' Roles and Responsiblities/Accountabilities:** Steinert mentions a variety of robots, ranging from vacuum bots and combat robots (254) to babysitting and eldercaring robots (255), and points out how their levels of autonomy and roles are different from each other. Could we use robots' roles and levels of autonomy as the basis to evaluate how responsible are they for their actions? A robot with more freedom to create its own decisions should be held accountable or more accountable than a robot with semi-autonomy. Still, engineers and programmers are the one who implements robots' roles and "ethical standards and routines" (254) that govern their autonomy. So, should we take this into consideration as well?
3. **Steinert's Meta Perspective:** "They \[ethicists] don’t hesitate to evaluate the influence of robots in particular niches such as medical care and the “social impact of intelligent artifacts” [35]. But they hardly illuminate the various forms of influence that robotics has on ethics itself" (256). What are "the various forms of influence robotics has on ethics itself"? What are the various forms of influence ethics has on robotics? I agree with Steinert that these two main fields must work together to create comprehsenive guidelines for roboethics, but I do not completely understand all his points like the role of anthropomorphism and how robotics influences ethics. 

- [David Levy's "The Ethical Treatment of Artificially Conscious Robots"](https://github.com/michaelshiloh/resourcesForClasses/blob/master/doc/theEthicalTreatmentOfArtificiallyConsciousRobots.pdf).
4. **Robots and Children:** Both articles bring up relations between robots and children quite frequently. For instance, Steinert talks about how children "conceiving of and treating AIBO \[dog robot] socially in some ways as if it were a real dog" (252-253). In "The Ethical Treatment of Artificially Conscious Robots," Levy points ouf the following: 
       If our children see it as acceptable behaviour from their parents to scream and shout at a robot or to hit it, then, despite the fact that we can program  
       robots to feel no such pain or unhappiness, our children might well come to accept that such behaviour is acceptable in the treatment of human beings. By 
       virtue of their exhibiting consciousness, robots will come to be perceived by many humans, and especially by children, as being in some sense on the same 
       plane as humans. (214)
Both authors seem to agree that children perceive robots as capable of receiving social treatments. Why do 
5. **Bias toward Robots:**
