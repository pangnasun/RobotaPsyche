[*I, Robot*](https://github.com/michaelshiloh/resourcesForClasses/blob/master/doc/I_Robot.pdf) 
by Isaac Asimov: Third Story: Reason

1. **Superior Being:** Cutie describes human as: "the material you made of is soft and flabyy, lacking endurance and strength, depending for energy upon the inefficient oxidation of organic material-like that. Periodically you pass into a coma and the least variation in temperature, air pressure, humidity, or radiation intensity impairs your efficiency" (51). On the other hand, Cutie describes himself as "a finished product. I absorb electrical energy efficient directly and utilize it with an almost one hundred percent efficiency. I am composed of strong metal, am continuously conscious, and can stand extremes of environment easily" (51). This description makes it very obvious that robots like Cutie are far superior than us human beings. Thus, how could we keep them in check? What gives us the right, the power, or the reason to make them stay under our control? What prevents them from making us their slaves?
2. **Robots' Religion:** Terms, such as Master, Prophet, and Truth, are used by Cutie and his followers to validate their superior existence. Coincidencely, we human beings also use these terms to explain our existence in term of God, Prophet, and Truth as well. Does this mean we live in a falsehood as those robots? If we use these terms to explain our existence, why can't those robots do the same? What draws the line between those robots' belief and our belief?
3. **Robots' Master:** At this end of this short story, Cutie still believes that the Converter is Master. This does not matter though because Cutie still does what he is made to do. Should he be left his way? What would happen if he figured out that what he's doing does not serve his "Master"? Shouldn't they make clear who the "real Master" is?
