# Final Project: Simulating a Simple Ecosystem-Updated Demo Videos

### Project Product
It turns out my project simulation is far simpler than what I planned. The final product is a simulation of two animals with two sizes. The ones with the larger size have higher chance to a predator while the smaller ones have higher chance to be a prey. Preys are coded to avoid predators. As the simulation is running, if the number of larger animals who are also predators surpasses the threshold, preys with associate larger animals as predators. At the end of the simulation, we will see that preys move with preys while predators move with predators.

#### About the info displayed in the simulation
- "Association: False" means the association has not happened yet. It switches to "Association: True" when association happens.
- "Threshold/Bots" shows the set threshold vs the total number of bots (animals). The threshold is set by multiplying the total number of animals by a certain percent. 
- "Current Status" shows the average number of large animals who are predators from all the rounds during the simulation. If the number is greater than the threshold. "Current Status" changes to "Associated at" to show that association has happened. 
- "Runtime" shows the time the simulation has been running.
